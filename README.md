to do:
====================

- fix slug so that it defaults to author_slug on creation but a slug field is added to the edit article form so you can set a custom one. 

- page count logic

- add validation errors to story and article admin pages for creating new pages

- customize ckeditor to only provide basic functionality (bold, italic, link, indent, and linebreaks). it seems like this can be done using their toolbar configurator utility [found here](http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/dev_toolbar) but they suggest that you not just edit the config file because all of the plugins will still be pre-loaded. more info about the rails integration [here](https://github.com/galetahub/ckeditor).

- refactor, refactor, refactor!
