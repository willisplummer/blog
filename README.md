to do:
====================


- polymorphic pages that can be associated with articles or stories(which are nested under articles)

- stories scraper for old site

- update scrapers to skip leading `<br>`'s on page content and author bios

- remove rich text editor (has way too many options, sends way too much info, loads inconsistently) - maybe replace with something that just tracks line breaks, bold, and italics.. this?

- ~~validate author url input begins with http://~~

- save password info in a private file

wishlist:
====================


- make page count automated or create a drop down to select page numbers based on the page count that you input?

- manual slug overwrite option in article form
